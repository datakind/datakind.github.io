#### Discovery Resources


##### Email templates


 The discovery stage involves a lot of nuanced communication with the partner organization! We have compiled [email templates and examples](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10d_OKPh5TPjpmSjkRYOHEgGgheMo2fIOm7RrXEgEbaM/edit#heading=h.5p0o26lutu9u) for a variety of situations in the discovery process for you to reuse and reference. 


##### Folder structure template


We have created a Google Drive folder to help you to organize all your project documents into folders that are consistent across all DataKind projects, making it easy for volunteers and staff across DataKind to find what they need and contribute to projects. It also organizes your work by the project stages for you, helping you stay on track. Additionally, it includes copies of all the DataKind templates, enabling you to simply edit the template directly in your project folder for easy use. At DataKind, we use Google Drive for project updates that need to be shared across the team, and GitHub for code only. Keep in mind that this folder structure is meant to be a helpful starting point to make your life easier \- it’s not prescriptive! Please edit the template to fit the unique needs of your project.



##### How do I use it?



Copy the folder structure template and all the templates inside it to create your own google folder for your project \- it takes less than a minute! Simply download the folder zip file, unzip, and then re\-upload to the correct place within DataKind’s google folder structure. Here are step by step instructions:


1. Navigate to the [Folder Structure Template](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ERryIMhqgUWrnQjs8jZWhofnJIBxEhdj)
2. Select the three vertical dots in the top right \> Download. (This will download a zip file.)
3. Unzip the file locally on your computer.
4. Navigate on Google drive within your web browser to where you want your folder to go:
* If it is a DataKind Global project, it should go in the “DK\_Projects” folder
* If it is a DataKind Chapter project, it should go in the project folder within your chapter folder

6. Drag the local folder from your computer into the desired web location



##### Tips and Best Practices



* Put a copy of the intake form results in the “1 Discover” folder for reference.
* Add a spreadsheet of final volunteer team information (emails, roles etc.) to the “3 Prepare” folder for reference.
