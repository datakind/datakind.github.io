#### MUST DO: Volunteer Agreements


Once selected for a project, all DataKind volunteers must have a signed volunteer agreement on file before starting to work with DataKind. If someone on a project has volunteered with DataKind before, ensure that their volunteer agreement is on file. If not, ask them to sign a new one. 


##### Steps in getting a signed volunteer agreement:


1. Find the Volunteer Agreement Template [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N6T27-a1teFDrTuX7mieVutJlZ_C10Yg/view?usp=sharing) and send it to your volunteers. Include it as early as possible in the information you give to new volunteers \- for example, include it in the application process, event sign\-up, event sign\-in, or pre\-orientation work.
2. Do not let volunteers begin contributing until they have signed. This is often done by telling volunteers that access to key project folders or documents will be given to them after they return their signed Volunteer Agreement.
3. Save all signed Volunteer Agreements in the project google drive folder accessible to DataKind Global staff.
4. Ask your staff contact person to update all volunteers' records in Salesforce to indicate that they have a signed volunteer agreement on file.


##### What is in the agreement, and why is it so important?


The Volunteer Agreement includes several components that are important to make sure volunteers are aligned on before they start working with DataKind:


* **Values.** The agreement asks volunteers to commit to abiding by our values, which helps create an inclusive and welcoming environment for volunteers.
* **Confidentiality.** We need a Volunteer Confidentiality Agreement from everyone because \- even if we are working with public data \- we are discussing the challenges that nonprofits face through DataKind engagements. Our partners tell us this information in confidence so that they can get our help, so this commitment to privacy is necessary for anyone involved in the project in any capacity.
* **Intellectual property.** The agreement states that any work products created will be property of DataKind, which is crucial so all DataKinders can reuse and build on each otherâ€™s solutions to help more social good organizations! In many cases, chapters use code and tools developed by other chapters for projects across sectors and the globe. We are committed to open sourcing as much of our code and products as possible.
* **Conflict of interest (COI).** The agreement asks volunteers to report any conflict of interest that may arise. If someone reports a COI, their staff partner talks it over with the operations team and makes a recommendation on a case\-by\-case basis.


##### Photo \& Video Consent


The final part of the Volunteer Agreement is photo \& video consent. If a volunteer is not comfortable being in photos or videos that we might share externally, they should clearly communicate this to the engagement organizers and agree on a plan. To support volunteers at events that do not want to give photo \& video consent, consider:


* Giving them a colored lanyard to wear. After the event, scan photos for the lanyards, deleting any found.
* Only take 1\-2 pictures and intentionally ensure the individuals are not included.
* In rare cases in which it would be impossible to avoid photos, we ask that volunteers unwilling to sign the consent to reconsider if they should attend an event.. Clearly indicate in the event description that all participants are consenting to photos when they choose to attend.
* If the event is virtual, remind volunteers they may turn off their camera if they do not wish to be on video.
