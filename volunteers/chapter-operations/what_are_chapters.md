Ever since we began our work in 2011, we’ve been dreaming of a vibrant network of DataKind communities across the globe — social sector and data experts mixing and mingling and working together to tackle the world’s toughest challenges through data science. We have volunteers that partner directly with DataKind’s global staff on volunteer opportunities. We also have [DataKind Chapters](https://www.datakind.org/join-us/our-community/) that enable us to further our mission and expand our impact. They are spearheading the data\-for\-good movement in their communities by organizing events and connecting local data scientist volunteers with mission\-driven organizations to uncover world\-changing answers through data. Chapters are volunteer\-led and represent some of the top data scientists and forward\-thinking social innovators around the globe. Our chapters are currently located in **Bengaluru, San Francisco, Singapore, United Kingdom, and Washington DC.**
