**Intended audience:**
DataKind Volunteers






#### Chapter Leader Emails


Upon signing the [DataKind Chapter Leader E\-Policy agreement](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FrREzsykQBpF7fqA9WTPpVQe8MH2bTfJ/view), Chapter Leaders are issued a [firstname.lastname@datakind.org](mailto:firstname.lastname@datakind.org) email address. These email addresses have [delegate access](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/138350?visit_id=638568115723777023-675358273&rd=1#zippy=) to their chapter's shared email inbox (e.g. dc@datakind.org, singapore@datakind.org).


##### Eligibility criteria


Only Chapter Leaders are eligible for a DataKind email address. If a volunteer steps down as a Chapter Leader but stays active with DataKind, they will lose their DataKind email address. Other volunteers (e.g. Scoping Squad members, DataCorps team members, etc..) are not eligible for a DataKind email address.


##### What if I don't want another email?


If you don't want to manage checking another inbox, you can set up [automatic forwarding](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/10957?hl=en) so your DataKind email automatically gets sent to your personal email address. You will still need to log in with you DataKind account to access resources like shared google calendars and google drive, though.


##### Setting up your email signature


Please follow [these instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DKfrmOWSjyBMg7WgTCj3b6VXxtCw5zoFoGWtM692dqc/edit) to set up your email signature. For “title,” you should write “ Chapter Leader” (e.g. “DataKind Bengaluru Chapter Leader”). Please note that the phone number, twitter handle, and Calendly lines are all optional \- feel free to leave them out if you prefer.
