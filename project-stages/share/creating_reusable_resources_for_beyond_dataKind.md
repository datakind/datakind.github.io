Could you convert some of your code into a template or reusable resource for similar projects? Did you apply a certain methodology to a social good problem in a way that someone else facing similar constraints on a social good problem might be able to benefit from? Could anything that you did on this project be valuable for other social impact organizations or DataKinders to repurpose?


If the answer to any of the above is yes, then you have the opportunity to support the DataKind community and broader sector by creating a reusable resource!There are a few things to keep in mind when you decide whether it is a good fit to create a reusable resource for your project:


* **Reliability:** Is there a chance your resource would break, and you wouldn’t have time to fix it? Open source resources can require a lot more long\-term work than you might suspect. Do not leave an open source resource in the wild without a maintenance plan! Potentially consider a code template instead of a product prone to errors when an API or data structure changes, which might be a lower lift to maintain. Whatever you decide, have a dedicated maintainer committed to ensuring the resource is useful in the long term.
* **Security:** Double check the partner organization’s proprietary requirements and that your idea for an open source tool would have no chance of exposing any PII. When there’s a risk or trade\-off between security and creating a reusable resource, always lean in the direction of security. Keeping people’s personal data safe is more important than releasing an open source tool.
* **Deprecation:** Consider how and when the resource might be retired. The determined maintainer should be prepared to come back to the project and depreciate the resource when that happens. Most likely, there are many situations that could lead to deprecation, some of which you can predict and some of which you cannot. Either way, stay informed and mindful of whether it makes sense to deprecate a resource as the environment changes.


If possible, we should follow the [Digital Public Goods](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard/) standards when developing a resource meant to be open source (such as software or an open data set). Below is a snapshot of the standards to follow that pertain to developing reusable, open goods. You can read more in the link above.


* **Use of Approved Licenses:** Use the appropriate [OSI license](https://opensource.org/licenses) in your project. This will protect DataKind from any modifications or uses of the software.
* **Documentation:** This includes README, web docs, and example code or notebooks for users. Documentation should make clear on how to install your open source tool and appropriate use cases of functionality. For public facing data, this means a data dictionary and a data governance document on how to interpret and use the data.
* **Clear Ownership:** Before developing a reusable tool, consider who will steward the tool, maintain it after release, and perform bug fixes and enhancements. This includes understanding the steward’s technical staffing and establishing clear contribution guidelines for users.


If you’re interested in submitting a resource you’ve built with your DataKind project to the [Digital Public Goods Registry](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry/) , we are happy to support! Reach out to your DataKind support team to ask for help.
