#### Checking in with the Partner Organization


Regular check\-ins with the partner organization go a long way towards setting up your project for success. Regular communication with the Project Champion throughout the project ensures that progress and expectations are shared and updated in real\-time, and any roadblocks or pivots that require collaboration between the DataKind team and partner organization can be swiftly addressed. Typically, the Project Manager sets up these meetings while the Data Ambassador runs them.


In addition to our [general recommendations for working with Project Champions](https://playbook.datakind.org/playbook/articles/133) the following are some specific tips from veteran DataKind volunteers for running effective check\-ins:


* **Getting started**
+ If the partner is in a different country or local context than you are, start by asking them what local holidays you should be aware of. Add those holidays to your own calendar and to any planning documents, so you can be aware of them and plan meetings/work around them accordingly.
+ Start each meeting with an icebreaker question, as a small way to remind everyone to keep having fun and treat each other as humans. Take advantage of [this list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bYfIjyJtwgDVhPvSJSmABu7fbY2JnB1rVlMYcfQNipc/edit#gid=0) for ideas!

* **Meeting attendees and roles**
+ Make sure that the partner organization’s Project Champion and/or Data Specialist can attend.
+ The Project Manager should take the lead to review project progress from the last meeting(s) and set the agenda for the next meeting, to ensure the DataKind team has the information needed to make progress.
+ Establish clear roles of all the individuals on a call to identify who's doing what, such as: notetaker, project manager, etc.. Otherwise, everyone will do nothing or everything.

* **Meeting agendas**
+ Always set an agenda for all meetings that focuses on the goal the meeting is trying to achieve, because it's easy to run out of time. Prioritize what will be most important, and focus on that. Send out the agenda in advance to keep meetings focused.. Also send out pre\-reading materials in advance of the meeting as much as possible so that everyone can come to the meeting with the same information to discuss.
+ Agree on an agenda for the next meeting at the last meeting. Write it down so it is discussed and there is alignment. Anyone can reply on the notes document directly to make sure there’s no confusion in the future.

* **Notes and documentation**
+ Take notes! Keep a running log of meeting notes and action items to share internally and with the partner organization. It's helpful to share your screen while taking notes so that anyone can capture anything that is incorrect in the moment and fix it.
+ Follow\-up a meeting with sharing concise, clear next steps that are not too long or short. Ask for confirmation and suggestions if anything was missed for alignment. This follow\-up email after a call is so important because it is easy to forget one hour later what you just talked about.

* **Other best practices**
+ In order to keep things moving, it can be helpful for the Data Ambassador, Project Manager, and anyone overseeing the project to have bi\-weekly check\-ins separate from the team meetings.
+ If the check\-in will involve an in\-depth conversation about your project methodology, consider preparing a document or slide deck summarizing what you want to convey ahead of time, as verbally explaining new complex ideas does not set your partner up to successfully process and respond in real time.
+ Don’t let conversations become too abstract in meetings. Keep track of tangible and specific tasks and outputs that are expected from everyone, so everyone knows what they need to do in the follow\-up.
+ Before a meeting or conversation, have it in your head what the best, worst, and likely outcomes are for the call. Agree on it beforehand with the team you are working on to all align in the meeting.
