##### Introduction to Checkpoints


Checkpoints are opportunities for the project team to check in on progress with the greater DataKind support team (e.g. staff or chapter leadership), and discuss challenges, provide and receive advice, and get questions answered. For Chapter projects, checkpoints are meetings in which the Data Ambassador and Project Manager check in with the Chapter Leader who is supporting them. For DataKind Global projects, checkpoints represent regular check\-ins for the volunteers with the staff person overseeing the project stages (typically a portfolio or project manager).


The purpose of Checkpoints is three\-fold: 


1. Keep a project from stalling by creating intentional space to make decisions about the next steps of a project and whether it is time to move forward.
2. Make sure everyone working on projects at DataKind has the opportunity to ask questions and get access to support and advice to help them.
3. Ensure DataKind is tracking project progress and producing quality work across our entire DataKind Network.


Checkpoints typically function best as conversations, but they can happen in a number of ways. For example, checkpoints can be quick discussions after an in\-person event. They can be scheduled calls to go over everything in detail, or they can be quick exchanges via Slack or email. Different projects, teams, and stages require different levels of engagement, so there’s no one set formula. In previous projects, for example, DataKinders expressed that bi\-weekly checkpoints provide a helpful level of feedback and information for decision making to effectively stay aligned with the project plan. Whatever the method you chose, make sure to document your internal check\-in process and schedule within your project materials. 


Despite the different directions the conversation can take, generally, you should expect the following from a Checkpoint:


1. Review your progress on the current project stage
2. Answer questions about the work you have done so far
3. Get answers to your questions
4. Hear general advice and best practices, and an overview of what’s next
5. Make a formal decision about whether or not to move into the next stage


If you are the DataKind support person overseeing a project, here is a  [brief video tutorial](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bT4fOZMK_nexnI63pbjDco59zu8tmr1t/view) for how to conduct a checkpoint check\-in.


#### The Discover Checkpoint


The Discover Checkpoint is when the volunteer(s) completing the discovery stage meet with their advisor or managerial support (either a Chapter Leader or DataKind Global staff person) to discuss the project potential candidly and make a decision on whether the team should move forward into the Design Stage. The go\-forward decision is ultimately in the hands of the advisor/managerial support. Make sure the decision is documented in your notes, and if the decision is to not move forward, have your DataKind staff contact enter a clear rationale in Salesforce in case the partner reaches out to DataKind again later.


#### Discovery Checkpoint Agenda template


The below is a suggestion for how to plan for and conduct the Discovery checkpoint, feel free to edit based on your specific needs!


Pre\-work: Send the documents you have created throughout the discovery process out for review (data maturity assessment, impact map, project statement, and concept note).
