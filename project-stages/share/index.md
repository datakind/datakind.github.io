The team delivers the final version and documentation so the partner can increase its impact.







#### Introduction to the Share Stage


sharing your project’s final learnings and results. In this stage, project volunteers participate in the group retrospective and complete a survey about their experience. Everyone works together in sharing the results of the project at the organization and/or with the DataKind community.


##### Team roles in the Share stage


* **Project Manager** \- Ensure handoff goes smoothly, update the project documentation, and conduct the retrospective. Work with the Data Ambassador to share project findings and lessons learned with the internal DataKind community, work with the DataKind Communications team to decide on how to share the project publicly, and finalize details for the evaluation plan before off\-boarding.
* **Data Ambassador** \- Ensure technical handoff goes smoothly and the partner organization is able to sustain the product delivered, potentially supporting the initial implementation or training staff as needed. Create the insight report and handoff presentation, present the findings to the partner organization leadership and decision makers, and present lessons learned to the internal DataKind community. Consider if there are reusable resources you can create from the project output and integrate learnings applicable to other DataKind projects. Finally, the Data Ambassador offboards, while ensuring their Chapter Leader or DataKind staff support has everything they need to close down the DataKind team cloud environments and implement a data retention or destruction plan after the project is evaluated. We appreciate Data Ambassadors coming back to the project briefly to help with these two tasks during the Evaluate Stage, but it is not required.
* **Chapter Leader** \- Chapter Leaders support DAs and PMs with all the above tasks, including ensuring partner organization satisfaction and providing guidance for presentations. They make sure everything that is in the project teams’ brains about the project and about conducting great projects at DataKind is documented before they are off\-boarded. Their primary responsibility at the end of the Share Stage is one of the most fun: to thank and celebrate the volunteers!


##### Share stage email templates


DataKind has created a [repository of email templates](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_mHj6vqsqwYgn6xoj1PQ7LC8e_zo26xz_3RGfZ5FwSM/edit?usp=sharing) that you can copy and paste for the Share Stage of the project process.


##### Share stage components


* Transfer deliverables to the partner organization, including well\-documented code base, instruction materials, and summary report documents
* Project champion signs off on received deliverable, indicating that project meets requirements
* If needed, support the initial implementation of project deliverables after hand\-off to set project champion up for adoption and sustainability
* Document project results and produce public facing materials using the case study template and guidelines
* Conduct internal retrospective
* Present findings to the DataKind Community
* Present findings to partner organization leadership and decision makers
* Consider what reusable resources you can create (such as sample code or guidelines to addressing similar projects) and make them if determined to be worthwhile
* Finalize details of evaluation plan with the Project Champion and decide on dates to be back in touch
* Survey volunteers, the Project Champion, and partner stakeholders
* MUST DO: Project team checks in with advisory team to review what they've shared and determine if there's anything or anywhere else to share
* Thank and celebrate volunteers!


\* See the “Chapter Leader Management” section of this playbook for more details on these steps.
