Volunteers are the lifeblood of DataKind! Our volunteers strategically apply their expertise to critical issues such as poverty, healthcare access, and mitigating the impacts of climate change, while working directly with both DataKind staff and our social impact partners.


If you are interested in volunteering, start by [creating a volunteer profile](https://datakind.rosterfy.com/login) so we can review your skills and experiences and let you know when projects arise that may be a good fit. You can also [subscribe to our newsletter](https://www.datakind.org/subscribe/) and [join our Slack community](https://dkcommunity.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-mkepgws6-Zo0v8UEfPiZl2xpSq91Mfg#/shared-invite/email) to stay in the loop about upcoming volunteer opportunities and events.


##### Types of volunteer opportunities


There are a few ways in which you can volunteer at DataKind:


1. Join a [Chapter](https://www.datakind.org/about-us/our-chapters/): Chapters are groups of local volunteers that organize events and connect with local mission\-driven organizations to complete Data Science and AI for Good projects. We are constantly learning; the Playbook is designed to be continuously updated as our processes and recommendations evolve.
2. Volunteer for a [DataDive® event](https://playbook.datakind.org/playbook/articles/170): DataDive events are high energy, marathon\-style happenings where mission\-driven organizations work alongside teams of volunteer data scientists, developers, and designers to use data to gain insight into their programs, the communities they serve and more \- all in 48 hours or less!
3. Volunteer for a [DataCorps® project](https://playbook.datakind.org/playbook/articles/173): DataCorps projects bring together teams of pro bono data scientists with social change organizations on long\-term projects that use data science to transform their work and their sector.
4. Additional volunteer opportunities: Sometimes we will invite volunteers to apply for specific one\-off volunteer roles. When this happens, we will send an email and share about it in our community Slack. These roles often require specific skills and experience and are detailed in the application process.

##### Volunteer Requirements


If you have little to no data science experience, that’s ok! We highly recommend volunteering for our DataDive events. They are a great way to learn or test new skills, and all skill levels are welcome.


For more specialized volunteer roles like a DataCorps® project, we typically look for volunteers with specific skills in data science, statistics, coding, data engineering, data visualization, and/or project management.


##### Benefits of volunteering with DataKind


Besides the warm fuzzy feeling you get from helping others, benefits of volunteering with DataKind include:
