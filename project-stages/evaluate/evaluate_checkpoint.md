#### Evaluate Checkpoint


The Evaluate Checkpoint is the final step of a project before sharing the evaluation learnings and permanently closing the project. Most importantly, the Evaluate Checkpoint is the time to ensure that the project has been fully evaluated, that the partner organization is supported in sustaining what was delivered, and that everything has been properly documented (including learnings) before the project is permanently closed. 


See the [Intro to Checkpoints](https://playbook.datakind.org/playbook/articles/127) for a reminder on how all checkpoints are conducted and how to prepare for them. If you have any questions or need support, you can always reach out to community@datakind.org! 


Agenda template (feel free to edit based on your specific needs!):


* Review and discuss what has been done and the steps completed
* Ask questions about the project and explain any unclear documentation as needed
* Make formal decision on whether or not the project will be ready to be closed after evaluation learnings are shared
* Discuss and agree on next steps
* Go over and answer questions on sharing evaluation learnings
* Answer any lingering questions


To conclude the Checkpoint, Chapter Leaders and/or staff should make sure that all project information is up\-to\-date in Salesforce.
