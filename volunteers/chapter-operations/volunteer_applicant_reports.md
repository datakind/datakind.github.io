While your chapter may host an open call to recruit volunteers for a particular project or event, potential volunteers can also [apply on the DataKind website](https://www.datakind.org/join-us/volunteer/) at any time. Applicants complete a more detailed profile with lots of info about their specific technical skills and experience, and every month new applicants and their information are added [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DVWQrSTNsakPPEQPJghUy0e1SiVQ3eZ5bv8ZlYq-pZg/edit?gid=212800809#gid=212800809).


A few things to note:


* Because the report contains applicant personal information, you need to be logged in with your @datakind.org email address to access it
* Each applicant's nearest chapter is in column E. Folks with a blank in that column aren't near any chapter, so anyone can reach out to them. Otherwise please just contact folks assigned to your chapter, or check with the relevant chapter leader before reaching out to someone assigned to their chapter.
* Column D indicates whether or not they opted into receiving marketing emails from us, so only add them to any mailing lists if that column has a "yes."
* Columns L\-AR contain their self\-assessment of their experience with various data science skills
* Columns AS\-AU contain open\-ended responses about their experience and interest in volunteering with DataKind
