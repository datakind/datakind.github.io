#### Diversity and Ethics in Volunteer Team Selection


Recruiting a diverse team with multiple viewpoints and skill sets is critical to creating high quality and ethical work. Diversity is the presence of differences within a group, e.g. in terms of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, ethnicity, nationality, socioeconomic status, language, (dis)ability, age, religious commitment, or political perspective. At DataKind, we aim to build diverse teams and foster an inclusive environment in alignment with our values.


Without a process for ensuring diversity considerations are built into volunteer recruitment, it is easy to default to selecting volunteers from your immediate network or who share your background, rather than the best qualified volunteers from a wide pool. Ensuring diversity in the volunteer recruitment and selection process is an integral part of our ability to do high quality work, because without diverse perspectives and the creativity that comes from diverse teams collaborating, we will have a poorer quality output. Additionally, team diversity improves the experience for volunteers and partners, as it enables everyone to grow and learn more.


We know diversity looks different in different cultures, geographies, and on different projects, so our processes at DataKind are flexible to be culturally sensitive and aligned with the needs of the project. Instead of one approach to diversity for all projects, we have the following best practices to keep in mind as you carefully design your volunteer recruitment and selection process with diversity and ethics in mind.


##### Before Volunteer Recruitment Begins


Across all projects, as a chapter, intentionally build mutually beneficial relationships with communities who have been historically excluded from tech and data science, especially those representing populations that are underrepresented in your chapter composition. Start by identifying these communities and key groups for DataKind to reach out to build relationships with. In the United States, this could include groups like [Black in AI](https://blackinai.github.io/#/), [Women in Data Science](https://www.widsconference.org/), or local tech diversity networks. Reach out to DataKind’s Community team to find out if DataKind has relationships with organizations representing groups historically excluded from tech and data science in your area. Intentionally seek out volunteer managers and chapter leaders who can help identify groups in your context that are underrepresented in tech and are skilled in pulling together and valuing people with diversity in mind. The Community team at DataKind is available to help with this, if you have any questions.


##### Before recruiting for a specific project:


* Reflect broadly on your chapter’s diversity. Ask yourself: “Who is our chapter composed of? Is the team sufficiently diverse with a range of skill sets, cultural backgrounds, and perspectives?” Keep your chapter’s current strengths and weaknesses in mind when making a plan for incorporating diversity into a particular volunteer recruitment process.
* Work with the partner organization to identify if it would be feasible to include volunteers from the communities impacted by the project results. These volunteers may not have data science expertise, but could still make valuable contributions as consultants, and on topics like designing a solution that will actually be adopted by the community. Name specific volunteer roles like “Designer”, “Subject Matter Expert”, “Project Manager”, or anything else that fits the need you are solving for in designing these roles. Be mindful that we don’t currently have the ability to pay volunteers, and we need to respect and value people’s time, especially those who have been historically disproportionately asked or forced to work for free. Work closely with the project partner to ensure the communities impacted are able to make this decision for themselves.
* Think carefully about your chapter’s accessibility practices \- do you ask applicants in advance if they have accessibility requirements, to ensure you can provide them? When planning an in\-person event, do you make sure to choose a venue accessible to those with impaired mobility? Creating a more accessible environment for volunteers enables more people to volunteer, and helps us live up to our DataKind value of commitment to diversity.


##### Promoting the Volunteer Job Description


* Start with the questions like “who’s voice should we have at the table? Are there any perspectives that we are missing?” Then, determine how you can attract volunteers with those perspectives.
* Consider how communities talk about volunteerism, it may or may not be the common term or language that’s used. Think about the language used by the communities you want on the team. For example, “community service” or “pro bono work” may resonate more in the community you are working in.
* Be intentional about where you recruit, so you don’t end up with the same small applicant pool every time. Post about the opportunity in diverse sources, especially those targeted at people with the backgrounds you identified as necessary in the previous question, and intentionally share beyond your immediate network.
* If possible, recruit from end users and the communities impacted by the project partner’s work.
* Clearly communicate in your promotion of the volunteer opportunity that volunteering with DataKind is meant to be mutually beneficial: volunteers help our partners, and volunteers learn from the experience.
* Consider data sensitivity issues and volunteer needs. That is, some DataKind projects will require volunteers to analyze and read sensitive data, which may be considered offensive. Communicate upfront to volunteers any potentially sensitive data and ask if there are other projects or aspects of work they would rather be considered for.


##### Volunteer Selection


* Create standardized interview questions and rubrics to ensure everyone is being graded on the same criteria, rather than interpersonal feelings and connection. See the Playbook article on [Volunteer Recruitment and Retention](https://playbook.datakind.org/playbook/articles/46/drafting-volunteer-needs) and more guidance on this.
* We recommend including a diversity statement on the volunteer job application, and asking a question like “how does this play out in your work?” This can be used as a filter question, as anyone who says “that’s not relevant to me” would not be a good fit for DataKind. We are not expecting all our volunteers to be diversity experts, but we want to make sure everyone on our teams believe that diversity matters, which increases the likelihood they can work effectively on diverse teams.
