    <h4>Article: Key Terminology</h4>
    <p>This article provides a list of commonly used terms at DataKind, and what we mean when we say them.</p>

    <p><b>Artificial intelligence (AI)</b> - Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to a collection of scientific disciplines and technologies that enable machines to carry out tasks that are usually associated with human intelligence, such as image recognition or text interpretation. Often the public use the terms “data science” and “AI” interchangeably, but they have distinct meanings.</p>

    <p><b>Data Ambassador (DA)</b> - the volunteer who leads the volunteer team working on a DataCorps® project. The DA is responsible for converting the partner's needs into scoped data problems, digging into the data to understand the depth of what can be done, and organizing the team's efforts to ensure successful project completion.</p>

    <p><b>Data science (DS)</b> - A discipline involving the use of computers to interpret data, model relationships in data, and create data-driven algorithms.</p>

    <p><b>DataCorps® project</b> - A long-term engagement that helps organizations use data science to transform their work and their sector. Note: “DataCorps” is always used as an adjective, and the first instance has the registered trademark ® sign. </p>

    <p><b>DataDive® event</b> - A high-energy, marathon-style event that helps partner organizations do initial data analysis, exploration, and prototyping, often over the course of a weekend. Note: “DataDive” is always used as an adjective, and the first instance has the registered trademark ® sign. For more information, read our <a href="https://playbook.datakind.org/playbook/articles/170">DataDive FAQ</a>.</p>

    <p><b>DataJam event</b> - Typically a 2-3 hour event where volunteers are cleaning and prepping data for further work, say at a DataDive event, or where volunteers are doing basic exploratory analysis, say as part of the scoping process for a longer-term engagement. </p>

    <p><b>DataKind Chapters</b> - All local divisions of DataKind, excluding DataKind Global. We currently have five chapters: Bengaluru, San Francisco Bay Area, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and Washington DC. You can learn more about our chapters on our <a href="https://www.datakind.org/about-us/our-chapters/">website</a>.</p>

    <p><b>DataKind Community</b> - All entities and people working under the DataKind name, including staff, volunteers, and partners across the DataKind Network.</p>

    <p><b>DataKind Global</b> - DataKind staff and volunteers who are not located in one of our Chapter locations.</p>

    <p><b>DataKind Network</b> - All Chapters worldwide, including DataKind Global.</p>
    
    <p><b>Discovery Day</b> - Typically a 3-4 hour event in which volunteers are paired with potential partner organizations to discover possible project opportunities and support them in their data strategy. For more information, read our <a href="https://playbook.datakind.org/playbook/articles/176/introduction-to-discovery-days">Discovery Day articles</a> in the Engagements section of the Playbook.</p>

    <p><b>Generative AI</b> - A subset of AI that uses algorithms called Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on large amounts of human-created content to generate new content such as text, images, or music, similar to what humans might produce (ie. ChatGPT). </p>

    <p><b>Human-centered design</b>  - A creative approach to problem-solving that starts with the people you're designing for and ends with new solutions that are tailor-made to suit their needs.</p>

    <p><b>Project Impact Statement</b> - a one-sentence statement explaining what your project will do and how that will map to the desired impact. Impact statements follow the format <i>“I want to (<b>analysis</b>) using (<b>data</b>) so that (<b>behavior change</b>) so that (<b>impact</b>).”</i></p>

    <p><b>Log Frame</b> - A tool which helps structure the main elements of a project, identifying and exhibiting the causal linkages between them. Once complete, log frames help improve planning, implementation, management, monitoring, and evaluation of projects. If interested, <a href="https://www.unodc.org/documents/human-trafficking/Toolkit-files/08-58296_tool_10-3.pdf"> read more about log frames here</a>.</p>

    <p><b>Machine learning (ML)</b> - The discipline of creating computer programs that automatically learn and improve from data, without being explicitly programmed. It is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention. (<a href="https://www.sas.com/en_us/insights/analytics/machine-learning.html#:~:text=Machine%20learning%20is%20a%20method,decisions%20with%20minimal%20human%20intervention">source</a>)</p>

    <p><b>Social impact organization (SIO), mission-driven organization, or social change organization</b> - catch-all terms we use to refer to any organization DataKind may engage with, which can include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>NGO - non-governmental organizations (Note: we do work with governmental organizations, so it’s better to use more inclusive terms below. This term is more commonly outside the U.S., say in Bengaluru.)</li>
        <li>Charity - most common in the UK</li>
        <li>Social actor - refers to an individual or collective who undertakes social action</li>
        <li>Nonprofit - an organization dedicated to furthering a particular social cause or advocating for a shared point of view</li>
        <li>Social enterprise - a revenue-generating organization with primarily social objectives whose surpluses are reinvested for that purpose</li>
        <li>Partner organization - a mission-driven organization or social change organization that DataKind is currently pursuing or working in partnership with in some capacity, most often on a project</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Project Champion</b> - The point person at a partner organization who connects the DataKind team with relevant organizational staff and end users, and keeps the project going from the partner organization’s side.</p>
    <p><b>Project Manager</b> - The volunteer who sets up and manages the necessary systems for effective technical project management, ensures the project team stays on track, and troubleshoots any roadblocks or issues that arise.</p>
    <p><b>Scoper</b> - The person who leads the Discovery and Design stages to assess whether there is a viable project, and helps shape the plan for the project and its intended outcomes. The person serving as Scoper might be DataKind staff, a Chapter Leader, a future potential Data Ambassador, or a volunteer dedicated to scoping projects for a chapter.</p>
    <p><b>Theory of change</b> - A living tool used by mission-driven organizations that links what they do, why and how they do it, who they are targeting for results, and what they expect to achieve. It is the organization's roadmap to change, and connects the dots between an organization's day-to-day program work and their ultimate mission.
