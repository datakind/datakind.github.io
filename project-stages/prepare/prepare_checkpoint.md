The Prepare Checkpoint is to ensure that you have time to finalize the detailed project plan. This is important because creating a project plan with clear stages and checkpoints, in addition to being customized to fit the project’s unique needs, is challenging. Confirm that you all agree with the number and frequency of checkpoints planned. You don’t want to go too long without checking in on project progress! Once everyone is happy with the project plan, sign off on the project to begin execution.


The Prepare Checkpoint should allow for plenty of time on aligning on next steps and what to expect for the upcoming execution stage, especially focused on what needs to be done before the next Checkpoint. End with a formal decision that it is time to begin project execution.


Agenda template (feel free to edit based on your specific needs!):


* Review and discuss what has been done so far
* Ask questions about the project and explain any unclear documentation as needed
* Review the project plan in detail and come to agreement on the number of checkpoints
* Make formal decision on whether or not to move into the next stage
* Discuss and agree on next steps
* Go over and answer questions on all steps necessary between now and the next Checkpoint
* Answer any lingering questions


To conclude the Checkpoint, Chapter Leaders and/or staff should make sure that all project information is up\-to\-date in Salesforce, including that volunteer Salesforce records have all been created and/or updated and that all volunteers have a signed volunteer agreement on file in the project Google Drive folder.
