    <h4>Researching an Organization + DataKind Value Alignment Check</h4>
    <p>Before initiating a project, you’ll need to conduct due diligence research to make sure that the potential partner organization is a good fit for a DataKind collaboration. If the organization doesn’t have a positive reputation and mission that’s aligned with DataKind’s mission or values, especially our values around diversity, equity, and inclusion, there’s really no potential for a project. Checking for DataKind value alignment includes four primary checks:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><b>Mission</b>: DataKind aspires to work with organizations making a positive and measurable impact on society. Ask yourself, what does the world look like when the organization succeeds? By partnering with them, are we able to both support the organization's work and advance DataKind's mission of “harnessing the power of data science in the service of humanity”?</li>
        <li><b>Theory of Change</b>: Do all their activities map to their mission, and thus ultimately move towards social impact? Are their activities aligned with DataKind values? For a summary of what a Theory of Change is, see <a href ="https://www.theoryofchange.org/what-is-theory-of-change/" > this article</a>.</li>
        <li><b>Expertise</b>: Do they have subject matter expertise in the area in which they are working? Do they understand the local and cultural context? Organizational domain expertise is essential because we bring data science capabilities, and need to work with people who have sector expertise to ensure success! </li>
        <li><b>Values</b>: Our most extensive check is to review DataKind’s values and compare them to the organization’s work and values. Do you see any overlap? Is there anything that is contradictory? This check includes looking specifically for subject matter expertise and for diversity, equity, and inclusion, as outlined below.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Additionally, make sure that you:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Determine whether the organization has been involved with any scandals or media controversy.</b> It’s best to politely decline the engagement if you think the organization’s public image will put DataKind's reputation at risk. A few quick Google searches for “[organization name] controversy” or “[organization name] scandal” should do the trick on checking for this issue.</li>
        <li><b>Make sure they have the right domain knowledge and subject matter expertise.</b> Throughout a given project, DataKind volunteers will need to consult members of the partner organization for their domain knowledge. So keep an eye out for whether staff employed by the organization you’re researching are experts in their issue area, and whether the organization is aware of other players and best practices in their own fields.</li>
        <li><b>Identify who their funders are. </b> For example, if the “Foundation for a Smoke-Free World” approached us to do a project, we might think: “Wow, what a nice mission!” But a little research will reveal that they are funded by the cigarette company Philip Morris, so we might want to be more hesitant.</li>
        <li><b>Consider whether they have any overt political stance or bias. </b>This is not necessarily a reason for disqualification; a lot of humanitarian issues are, unfortunately, politically-contested. But do pause and carefully consider whether the organization is aligned with DataKind’s goals when working with political organizations.</li>
    </ul>


    <h5>DEI Due Diligence Research</h5>
    <p>The most important part of value alignment at DataKind is conducting Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) due diligence research to ensure that all potential partner organizations are aligned with DataKind in prioritizing these essential values. </p>
    <p>All organizations, including DataKind and all potential partners we speak with, are somewhere on a continuum in their DEI work. For example, they fall somewhere on this continuum on becoming an anti-racist, multicultural institution:</p>
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="assets/img/DEI Due Diligence Research_Picture1.png" alt="Discovery Stage DataKind Project Process">
    </div>
    <p>(<a href= "https://racc.org/wp-content/uploads/buildingblocks/foundation/Continuum%20on%20Becoming%20an%20Anti-Racist,%20Multicultural%20Institution.pdf">Source</a>)</p>
    <p>As another example, they would fall somewhere on this gender continuum:</p>
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="assets/img/DEI Due Diligence Research_Picture2.png" alt="Discovery Stage DataKind Project Process">
    </div>
    <p>(<a href ="https://www.unicef.org/evaluation/media/1226/file/UNICEF%20Guidance%20on%20Gender%20(Full%20version).pdf">Source</a>)</p>

    <p>These continuums are not meant to be comprehensive, as we would need to include continuums for inclusion of the disabled, LGBTQI+ community, and other historically excluded groups to reflect our prioritization of DEI at DataKind. Rather, they demonstrate examples of how to think about organizations in their efforts to be diverse, equitable, and inclusive. There is no “DEI rubric” to score organization on, instead we aim to spur awareness, dialogue, and discussion to improve DataKind’s ability to:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Check our organizational bias towards favoring organizations founded and/or led by white people and other historically advantaged groups,</li>
        <li>Better understand the people who are likely to be impacted by a project, and explore ways to enable their participation in project design and execution, and</li>
        <li>Find more opportunities to partner with organizations further along these continuums, such that a collaboration is more likely to result in efforts to address issues of equity.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>This research is not meant to be a checklist of requirements for partnership, but rather information for you to critically consider as you determine whether this is a partner DataKind should be comfortable and excited about working with. Is the organization seeking to make progress on the continuum of being a diverse, inclusive, and equitable organization? Is this something they work on and care about? We don’t expect any of our partners to be perfect, as we are not perfect ourselves and “perfection” is not actually possible, but we would be thrilled to work with partners who share these values and priorities.</p>


    <h5>For all organizations</h5>
    <p>We are working on customizing these recommendations for different countries and cultural contexts, but the following considerations should be taken into account regardless of where the organization works.</p>
    <!---
    
    <td>
            <strong>Problem identification</strong><br>
            Activity/tool: pre-mapped logic models based on a shared theory of change (from initial case note) and publicly available theories of change; draft problem statement(s)
          </td>
          <td>
            What are the pain points the organization faces? (confirmation & expansion of existing concept note)
            <ul style="font-size: inherit !important;">
              <li>Who experiences these pain points (e.g., a specific program, specific role/position affected, specific geography)?</li>
              <li>Over what timeframe is the pain experienced?</li>
              <li>What does this pain prevent the team from achieving? / How does this pain point limit success/organizational ability to create change?</li>
            </ul>
            What else keeps you up at night?<br>
            ** Cautionary note: It is easy to hone in on the first problem and/or proposed solution during the first discovery call. Avoid this problem by closely following the points below.<br>

            <th>Means of verification*</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Leadership</strong><br>For social impact organizations that focus on specific target groups, representation from those groups in leadership positions is indicative of being on the more inclusive end of the continuum. It is expressed as the desired state in “data for co-liberation.” DataKind is excited to find and work with organizations leading by example of sharing control in decision-making with the people most affected by those decisions.</td>
            <td>Are any of the leadership team and/or board members from the communities the organization serves?<br>
              <br>
              Does the organization center the communities they serve?<br>
              <br>
              Explore ways in which communities are involved as stakeholders - e.g. listening sessions, decision making, power sharing, type of work or maybe even through policies that support communities of color or communities that have been marginalized - e.g. vendors they work with, reimbursement policies to staff and/or communities that contribute.
            </td>
            <td>(1) Website (bios of staff / board members)<br>(2) Online research on key people in leadership roles<br>(3) Discovery call conversation</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Reputation</strong><br>This is about checking our own bias with preemptive efforts to call out when we recommend an organization because of familiarity, perceived credibility, or reputation. A well-known organization does not necessarily mean a better organization. A number of nonprofits have had stories come out about issues like underpaying and mistreating staff of color or other historically excluded groups.</td>
            <td>With known bias towards large/well-known nonprofits in mind, have you heard of this organization before? If yes, where and what did you know about them before this Discovery process?<br>
              <<br>
              Do basic due diligence research on the organization, to see if there are any news stories or reports about it. Do not assume that the commonly known reputation is sufficient.
            </td>
            <td>(1) Online research and news sources</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Workforce</strong><br>Ask about diversity in the workforce, in particular whether people in the workforce are from the communities that the organization services.</td>
            <td>How does the organization promote workforce diversity, equity, and inclusion?</td>
            <td>(1) Website / Career page / Job description<br>(2) Social media promotion of open roles</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Location and accessibility</strong><br>This is especially relevant when an organization is not based or headquartered in a location where they do a large portion of their work. For example, a legal counsel organization for low income immigrants might only be accessible online, or only in the country’s dominant language.</td>
            <td>To what extent is the organization physically accessible by, or present in, the community served?<br>
              <br>
              If, in the course of the pandemic, the organization had to go remote, how did the team ensure the community maintained access?
            </td>
            <td>(1) Google maps + public information / open data on diversity statistics<br>(2) Discovery call conversation</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>*It is best for the Scoper to think about a variety of means of verification, as many community organizations lack budgets to build robust websites; it is important to combat inadvertent bias towards partnerships with organizations who have the “snazziest” websites.</p>

    <h5>For organizations in the United States</h5>
    <p>The following should be taken into account for US-based projects. </p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Context</th>
            <th>Questions</th>
            <th>Means of verification*</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Commitment</strong><br>This is an opportunity for DataKind to understand whether the organization cares about DEI. Organizations that are committed to growing their DEI practice often begin with the symbolic gesture - such as making an official policy statement. But there might be other mechanisms, such as their programs or policies, that show us how their priorities compare with their stated intent. If there is no public statement, we recommend finding out more through a conversation during the discovery phase.</td>
            <td>What is the organization’s public position on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) and/or racial equity?<br>Is there a written DEI and/or racial equity policy or plan publicly available?<br>
              <br>
              How does the organization, or its programs, promote DEI?
            </td>
            <td>(1) Website, mission statement, blog post or social media<br>(2) Annual report or Strategic Plan<br>(3) Discovery call conversation</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Workforce</strong><br>Look for an indication of intentional efforts to be inclusive. One of the easiest places for an organization to claim their position on DEI is in statements on job descriptions. For example, it is not the best if it's in fine print in the terms & conditions and only there because it's mandated by equal opportunity law!</td>
            <td>How explicit are the organization’s recruitment policies on encouraging BIPOC, disabled, LGBTQI or other people from historically excluded groups to apply to open positions?<br>
              <br>
              Are statements of encouragement easily visible in the job description or social media posts about open positions?
            </td>
            <td>(1) Website / Career page / Job description<br>(2) Social media promotion of open roles</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
