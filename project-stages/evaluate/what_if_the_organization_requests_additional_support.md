As part of the qualitative evaluation, you asked the organization whether there is any additional support they might need. This question can lead to a number of different situations, all of which require careful discernment to establish the appropriate next steps.


If the support they need is a simple one\-off consultation to get the product back on track or fix a bug, see what we can do to support the organization accordingly. We always want to deliver products that our partners can actually use. 


If the support they requested sounds like it could be a whole new DataKind project, evaluate if the DataKind team has capacity to take on another project. Additionally, if you were not on the implementing team for this project, review the retrospective results to identify if working with this partner organization was a positive experience for DataKind. If working with the partner organization was difficult or unpleasant for our volunteers, we do not want to do another project for them. If we have capacity and a good relationship, this is an excellent opportunity to start scoping a new project with a trusted partner! 


If you decide that the partner organization would be a good fit for a second project, you can restart at the Discover Stage (although a few steps, like vetting the organization and assessing their data maturity, do not need to be completed again). Check in with the Scoper and/or project team members to make sure everyone is aligned on the starting point. Confirm that the Project Champion will still be the point of contact and have capacity to work with DataKind, and then the Discovery checks can be completed much more quickly with a trusted partner.
