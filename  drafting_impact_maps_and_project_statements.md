#### Double Your Donation


##### Your Employer May Match Your Volunteer Hours!


We absolutely appreciate the contributions of your valuable time and amazing talents with DataKind in the data for social good movement! Our commitment to this work requires meeting our financial goals, which you can easily support with the time you’ve already donated, since many companies offer employee matching. (win\-win!)


Completing this short form \- <https://forms.gle/YY6ip4WMT1j3u3Pj9> \- will help generate a personalized letter you can forward to your employer in order to request a matching donation. They will then be able to make a donation to DataKind on behalf of your time volunteering!


Thank you for being an important part of the DataKind volunteer community. Together we are harnessing the power of data science and AI in the service of humanity. If you have any questions or need further documentation, reach out to [community@datakind.org](mailto:community@datakind.org). We’re happy to help!


##### Why raise funds as a nonprofit powered by spectacular volunteers?


Being a not\-for\-loss nonprofit, we fundraise to support the service of ensuring your experience is as smooth and fulfilling as possible \- this includes finding passionate project partners and scoping out preliminary details for high\-impact projects so it's primed for you, the volunteer, to be the technologist bosses you are. And we want to continue growing the great work across our global network, which requires finding corporate partners who are willing to give financially to support this work.

#### Drafting Impact Maps and Project Statements


*“This is THE MOST IMPORTANT part of the entire DK process… converting an ill\-formed business problem into a data science\-ready project is absolutely the key to success.”* \- Jake Porway, DataKind's founder and Executive Director of nine years


At this point, you have already looked at organizational data readiness, availability, and maturity. You are in the process of scoping a couple project ideas, and are ready to write the impact statement:


*“I want to (**analysis**) using (**data**) so that (**behavior change**) so that (**impact**).”*


Example: Medic Mobile wants to **predict the number of lives saved for new deployments**using the **Lives Saved Tool data**so that **they can more effectively select new public health programs** so that **more lives are saved**.*(See additional examples[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KJMFYVwQ8ku-IvgkuzpwVs5YTPHQiMrOb-4KvdAvBIA/edit#heading=h.yrp7h7p5jy3j))*


Here is [a version of the project statement template ready to share with the partner organization.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qvWlr24GmNXw_YBNRjTRGg5d43HeiNJN/view)Additionally,[this Playbook article introducing project statements](https://playbook.datakind.org/playbook/articles/169/introduction-to-project-statements)is a great resource to share with a partner organization that wants more details on what to expect.


##### Inputs


* Your notes from your discovery calls with the partner
* A copy of the [impact map template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i4Iplet0YFJ12SkH1SRQwN9ZMjcZniYxUiWQ2ReFfhg/edit#gid=31121870)for your project
* A copy of your partner’s  [theory of change](https://playbook.datakind.org/playbook/articles/151/key-terminology)
* A call scheduled \- consider working together on this with the partner organization!


##### 1 Start with your organization’s goals


From your discovery calls, you already have answers to the following questions:


* What’s your mission?
* What’s your vision?
* What change do you want to see in the world?
* What keeps you up at night?
* What does the world look like when your team has fulfilled its mission?


The “so that (impact)” will be that ultimate goal that the partner is trying to achieve. Your project should ultimately map to this goal. Pick a couple possible answers to that question, and put them in the associated column in your impact map.


#### 2 Identify pain points


Review your partner organization’s theory of change. Going back to your discovery call notes, review your partner’s answers to the following questions:


* What is the process for achieving your vision?
* How do you map your activities to your mission?
* What are the outcome levels?
* What is the user experience for your beneficiaries?
* Review your logic model or theory of change, and...
+ Identify bottlenecks
+ Imagine areas that could be improved

* What are some of the pain points or challenges your team faces?


Look at these answers in combination with your partner’s theory of change, and add possible (behavior change)’s to your impact map, identifying areas that you could address to truly move the needle on a goal. As you scan the theory of change, you’ll likely see several options of things that could go here. Keep thinking creatively, and come up with several options. What change do you want to make that will end up completing the vision?


#### 3 Suggest some data science solutions!


Now, it’s time to start brainstorming some data science solutions to address the challenges you uncovered! Going back to your discovery call notes, review your partner’s answers to the following questions:


* What data science project do you think would help you address these issues or pain points?
* Do you want to understand the past, improve the present, or predict the future?
* Who will be the users of the data solution? How will they use it?
* If 100% of people adopted the solution, what would it solve?


Look at these answers together with your partner’s theory of change, and add possible “I want to (analysis) using (data)”s to your impact map.


Make sure all your ideas clearly map to the goal, and add any intermediate “so that” steps needed to clearly demonstrate how the data science project will lead to the change. Create as many project statements as you can think of, this is the time for creativity! Later, the data audit will narrow the scope of the project to something realistic.


#### 4 Craft the external version


That impact statement can be hard to read externally, so we can also frame the same information like so:


Organization X exists to (mission). They do this through (theory of change). They have (a problem statement / hurdle to doing their work). We’re proposing to use (data) to do (analysis) that will ultimately (behavior change), leading to (impact).


For example: MedicMobile exists to provide life\-saving healthcare to those who live prohibitively far from hospitals. They do this through deployments of cellphone\-based healthcare programs. They have difficulty knowing which programs to deploy in which regions to maximize the number of people helped. We’re proposing to build a software interface to the “Lives Saved Tool”, a statistical model for public health officials to estimate impact, that will predict the number of lives saved for new MM deployments. This solution will ultimately help MM more effectively plan their public health programs, leading to more lives saved.


***Every project should have a paragraph like this that all team members can understand.***
