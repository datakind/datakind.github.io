#### The Service Agreement


Congratulations \-\- if you’ve made it to the Services Agreement, that means you’re ready to launch a project! How exciting! But before you jump right into the project work, note that roughly 10 business days are needed for DataKind’s Operations Team to complete a contract review, and this MUST be in place before any work is done.


We are ready to work with you to get it done as quickly as possible, so as soon as you are ready, connect the partner organization and your DataKind staff point person (typically the Community team or your project's Portfolio Manager) by email noting that the partner is ready to receive the agreements. Then the staff point person will take it from there.


(If you are curious about what happens next, your staff contact will send the documents to the project partner for review and answer any questions they may have. Once both parties are in agreement, the partner and a DataKind representative will each sign and the fully executed agreement will be shared with both parties and saved in the project Google Drive folder.)


The Services Agreement essentially says that the intellectual property that comes from this project belongs to DataKind because it comes from our work (i.e. the work product is ours), but we are committing that the project partner has a sublicense to the work. Therefore, they can feel free to use the work product however they choose for as long as they like. They are giving us license to use the data, and we are giving them the right to use the product we build. We will never revoke these licenses. 


This is important because we often build upon the products from past projects at DataKind. For example, we built a tool for route optimization for SOIL Haiti, which we then a couple years later used for a completely different project transporting COVID samples. It’s still a route optimization model, but using all new data. Therefore, it is important that we own the work product so we can reuse it with other projects.
