Ensure that you have closed down all the technical and cloud environments as part of offboarding, so that data remains properly protected and DataKind’s systems and structures remain organized and set up for future projects. 


Make sure to check on the following:


* Check that all the final datasets are [secured](/project-stages/evaluate/data_publication_or_destruction)
* Double check that the NDA and data security steps are completed
* Check that all documents and information from the project is stored in Google Drive
* Change the Google Drive settings so that they are not shared outside of staff
* Delete the team on Asana (if needed)
* Archive the Slack channel for the project
* Close the AWS instance
* Make sure [final code](/project-stages/execute/coding_and_working_with_data_at_dataKind) is hosted on DataKind’s GitHub
* Remove GitHub access from volunteers if they are no longer contributing to the repository
* Close out the contract


If you have any challenges or are not sure about an element of closing a technical project, do not hesitate to reach out and ask.


That’s it!!! You did it!!! Once you’ve shared the project’s evaluation, you have finished the final step of a DataKind project. Congratulations! Thanks for all you do, and we can’t wait for the next one!
