The partner organization team is made up of a few key roles, sometimes with one person serving multiple roles: 



* **Project Champion**\- the primary contact for the DataKind team, connector of all teams within the partner organization to the DataKind team, and subject matter expert to answer all your questions as a DataKind volunteer
* **Executive Sponsor**\- executive director or senior leader that supports the project and ensures it stays a priority for the organization
* **Data Specialist(s)**\- may be a chief technology officer, data manager, or other technical role on staff that has access to or understands the details of the organization’s data
* **End User(s)**\- those who will ultimately be using the deliverables are our end users. They should be available for design and workflow\-related questions and will be checking in on key deliverables, to ensure the DataKind team is building adoptable solutions.



While all these roles are important, we want to highlight the particular importance of ensuring there is a strong Project Champion and Executive Sponsor in place.


The **Project Champion** should be someone who understands that the project process itself is valuable, and has the time and interest to ensure the volunteer team is aware of the context, usage, and challenges involved in implementing the data science solution. We ideally want to work with someone who will use the project output, as we do our most successful work when working alongside the end user to understand what the product means to them. The Project Champion should be a subject matter expert in the project area, as well as demonstrating that they value Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), as determined through our [DEI due diligence research process](https://playbook.datakind.org/playbook/articles/22). 


Leadership investment is one of the most important factors in project success, more than organizational size, reputation, or data maturity. The organization's Executive Sponsor and leadership team need to:



* Be invested in data \- Decision\-makers at the organization should be bought\-in to using data to inform decisions, not just to report or to prove their agenda.
* Believe in the value of volunteers \- A willingness to trust the work of our expert data scientist volunteers as well as an understanding of the flexibility needed when working with volunteers is essential to a successful partnership. If this understanding does not exist, it might be better to recommend them to a data science consulting organization instead. That said, when scoping a project, try to use language that is familiar to the potential partner organization \- e.g. “pro bono data scientists” \- to set the potential partner at ease.
* Agree to promote and support implementation of the project \- Leadership strategy and resource allocation should be aligned with the goals of the project. The decision\-makers at the organization should be excited about the anticipated results of the project, and prepared to prioritize supporting it at the organizational level.
* Be innovation\-ready, able to make decisions, and have a point of view \- Executive Sponsors that are “fine with whatever” or let DataKind make all the decisions do not have a clear end\-state vision, and do not understand what the specific requirements of the solution are. They need to have an informed point of view to make good decisions and ensure that the tool will actually get used.
* Be value aligned regarding Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) \- As part of our DEI due diligence research, we ask the question: “Are any of the leadership members from the communities the organization serves?”. DataKind believes that it is essential for our partner organizations' leadership teams to center the communities they serve. For more information on this element of the project partner leadership qualities, see the section on DEI due diligence research in the [DataKind Value Alignment Playbook article](https://playbook.datakind.org/playbook/articles/22/datakind-value-alignment).
