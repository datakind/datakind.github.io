[Recruiting a diverse team](https://playbook.datakind.org/playbook/articles/61/diversity-ethics-in-volunteer-team-selection) does no good if there aren’t practices in place to ensure that the team is inclusive and equitable. Onboarding and training all volunteers in these practices ensures everyone can truly feel welcome. 


This perspective is especially important when you have people bringing different types of skills to the project. For example, if you bring someone onboard with design skills or contextual knowledge, make sure they are included in all relevant conversations, but do not waste their time in technical conversations that they wouldn’t understand and may find discouraging. 


Take advantage of [inclusive team building activities](https://www.playmeo.com/fun-inclusive-diversity-team-building-activities/) and consider [co\-creating community agreements](https://www.nationalequityproject.org/tools/developing-community-agreements) with your project team. This can help teams come together to establish how teams work, communicate, and make decisions together. Remember to keep accessibility in mind and ensure that all activities, agreements, working norms, and communication norms are inclusive of everyone on the team.


Here are some reflection questions you may consider as you onboarding your team:


* Is the team diverse and representative of a range of skill sets, backgrounds, and perspectives?
* Is everyone respected and valued for their contributions, especially across different skill sets? (e.g. if you bring someone onboard with design skills or contextual knowledge make sure to include them in all relevant conversations and value their input, but respect their time by not including them in technical conversations not relevant to their expertise.)
* How am I fostering collaboration and communication across the team for members from different backgrounds and experiences? For example, do all team members feel comfortable speaking?
* How might discussion and presentation norms impact team dynamics or reinforce professional stereotypes (e.g., males dominate as speakers, etc.)?


Are there practices, such as allowing teams to self organize, that may reinforce biases? For example, meetings should be structured in a way that enables everyone to think through problems independently, share divergent opinions, and be celebrated for their creative thinking. This can help prevent groupthink, which can come out of a volunteer engagement in which everyone wants to be nice and cooperative. At DataKind we are kind, but we believe that clarity is kind. We are tough on ideas, but gentle on people. 


Take note of which volunteers remain engaged with DataKind after completing a project and which do not. Are there patterns that indicate certain groups may feel more welcome than others? If you notice members with a particular shared identity tend to return at lower rates than others, do some research into why that is (e.g. request feedback from volunteers about their experience) and how you can improve the experience of people with that identity.
