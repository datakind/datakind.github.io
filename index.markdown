    <h4>Introduction to the Playbook</h4>
    <p>The Playbook is a living knowledge base that enables the reader to design and implement a Data Science and AI for Good project following DataKind’s approach. The Playbook codifies the lessons we’ve learned from our failures and successes for use on future projects, making it easier for DataKinders around the globe to do the best work possible through sharing knowledge and resources</a>.</p>

    <h5>About DataKind</h5>
    <p>DataKind tackles the world’s toughest challenges with data science and AI to improve the capabilities, reach, and scale of social impact organizations. Check out our website to learn more about <a href="https://www.datakind.org/about-us/our-story/" target="_blank">our story</a>, <a href="https://www.datakind.org/our-work/datakind-products/" target = "_blank">our approach</a>, and <a href="https://www.datakind.org/our-values/" target="_blank">our values</a>.</p>

    <h5>About the Playbook</h5>
    <p>The Playbook was developed by DataKind staff, in partnership with volunteers, to be a central source of the best practices and resources we’ve developed over a decade of Data Science and AI for Good projects. If you’re curious, you can read a full writeup of the Playbook development process. We continuously review and update the playbook based on our latest work and feedback from users, so let us know what you think!</p>

    <h5>Playbook Guiding Principles</h5>
    <p>The primary audience for the Playbook is DataKind volunteers to guide them in their work, but it’s also useful for data professionals supporting social sector actors more broadly. The Playbook is maintained around these three guiding principles:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><b>A living document:</b> We are constantly learning; the Playbook is designed to be continuously updated as our processes and recommendations evolve.</li>
      <li><b>A set of standards:</b> We document project standards to ensure that all of our work is high quality technically, and with equity, justice, and co-liberation top of mind across our global network.</li>
      <li><b>An answer to the question “how do I do this?”: </b> The Playbook exists to answer the questions of HOW to do various components of a project. Recognizing that all projects are different and processes need to be flexible, the articles include a variety of options for the “how,” so that the method can be adjusted to the cultural context and specific needs of the project.</li>
    </ol>
